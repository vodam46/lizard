probably better ui libraries

support multiple body types
	not just bilateral?
	different shapes of each body part/leg
		triangles
		squares
		different sides
			same as snake

maybe some textures?

better legs
	update them when theyre on the wrong side of the body
		when elbow angle > body angle?

stop them from converging, somehow - if they go for the closest target
	claimed targets?
	actual AI?
		boid-like?

vector metatable
	improve the usage of it
	more functions?
	using normal numbers
	change to an actual class?

more options!!!
save the options

move all the various definitions to separate files
change the hardcoded stuff to constants?
	- menu positions
	- editing window size
	- all the strings - would make changing languages easier

pause -> muted colors of the creatures in the background?

different colors for body parts

annotations!!!

different length for forearm and the arm

different languages? - for my brother

relative window size

positions not related to window size

some of the functions i use in python?
	- sum, list comprehensions?

some sort of randomizer for distances, so they dont look so goofy

prettifycation - if i want to show it to other people, i need to make it
look actually decent

improve the editor
	- learn from some other editors?
	- undo
